ways to travel:
	by foot
	in a car/any possible vehicle out there:
		planes
		boats/ships
		trains
		horses or whatever animal you can abuse
		bicycles / unicycles / tricycles / <n;n∈ℕ>cycles ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
		oh and motorcycles when we're at it
		yeah and you can also strap like a kbhghilion balloons to your roof and lift your house into the air (ok you can't but whatever, isn't this about creativity?)
	ok now for the *sports*:
		you can run
		f a s t   w a l k i n g
		rollerskates
		skateboards
		yeah and the n-cycles should have been here too ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
		SWIMMING
		ok so this one applies only to one guy who died like 2000 years ago but you can also walk on water
		jumping into something below you also gets you into a stable state
			oh of course and all the types of jumping: pole jumping, that thing where they jump into sand I can't remember the name of it for god's sake ... etc.
	ok and this is where we really start to tackle the idea of what transportation actully is:
		so how I would define transpotation is:
			a CONTROLLED action that gets an object from one stable configuration into another stable configuration (where all the forces acting on the body cancel out) and changes the positon of the object
		so:
		this should technically include:
			sliding down a slide - oh and of course a slip'n-slide shoul also count, right?
			using a zip-line
			catapulting yourself or an object (I've just remembered that you can also transport objects..  ooooh boy am I gonna wite like 456*10^574 more items into this list)
			shooting with a cannon
			swinging from one cliff to another where the rope is suspended on a helicopter
			sitting on an office chair and using a fire extinguisher as a thruster to propell yourself
			and I almost forgot: ROCKETS!!!!!!!!!!
			quantum teleportation
			WHEELCHAIRS
			pushing a car because it's run out of gas
			walking using the stick-leg-attachment things (I can't remember their name)
			THROWING SOMETHING is a way to transport things
			*electric current technically transports ions from one end of the wire to another*
	imagining fake scenarios in your head and travelling places

	OK THERE IS A LOT MORE I really need to get into the other excercises


ok I have already written the other excercises somewhere else, so I'll just show you my answers when we're checking them or something, I actually did the page 155 before when I confused the excercise we were supposed to do abot a week ago, I really hope you trust me with this one
