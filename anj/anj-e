#		SHELDON COOPER

	I don't kwnow many fictional characters so
I'm going to write about Sheldon Cooper from "the
big bang theory". I could talk a lot about the ac-
tor that plays his role and other back stories to
the series, but I think our task was to just talk
about he character as if they were a real person.
Sheldon - full name Sheldon Lee Cooper lives in
an apartment in Pasadena (California). He works as
a theoretical physicist in the californian insti-
tute of technolgy.
	Sheldon is one of the smartest people on
the planet - however, his high IQ only seems to
compensate for his lack of social skills. He's ve-
ry selfish and mean to other people. He finds emo-
tions and social relationships unnecessary and
does not find enjoyment in many social interac-
tions. It really seems as if he had some kind of
asperger's or other mental illness, however, he
has passed every psychological test just fine.
Sheldon is very selfish and doesn't really care
about the wellness of other people around him. He
likes to live in his own world of math and physics
and thinks everything he doesn't like is bad.
	Although Sheldon really likes and believes
in physics, He also likes watching sci-fi and
fantasy shows. I think this shows a lot about him,
because it implies there is at least a bit of cul-
tural potential inside him and that if he really
tried, he could become a 'normal' social person
(and that's what we actually see in the show - he
gets married, shares a toothbrush holder.. etc.).
	Sheldon has also very little sense of hu-
mor (which develops throughout he show). He doesn'
t understand irony and after evry joke he says he
has to say 'Bazinga'. Sheldon doesn't like engi-
neers and geologists - saying that the only real
science is physics. The story of the whole series
is about Sheldon developing social skills ralising
that intelect is not the only thing that matters
about a person.
