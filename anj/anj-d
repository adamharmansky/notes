#	DESCRIPTION OF A PERSON

	The person I'm going to write about is Roland. He is
one of my best friends. We are the same age and we also used
to go to the same elementary school. He lived his whole life
in Kosice.

	Roland clearly doesn't mind what people think about
him. He dresses like a homeless man and his hair is long and
messy. His square face is covered in pimples and scratches
and you can clearly tell he's absolutely okay with it. It
often even seems as if he didn't feel pain or something. He
can walk aorund the whole day and then ralise his leg was
bleeding. He just doesn't have time to focus on unnecessary
thing like that. His personality and behavior is very
different from mine. He likes doing things his own way, but
doesn't really like getting into arguments. He just wants
to enjoy life and get the most out of it while he can. He's
very creative and dreams of becoming a designer. He also
likes working with computers and we often play videogames
together.

	You can easily recognize Roland when you see him on
the street. Sometimes he's a little too loud and he does't
mind getting a lot of (not neccessarily positive) attention.
The way he moves is swift and chaotic. He gets absolutely
furious when he's assigned a task he doesn't want to do at
the moment. Especially when his parents want something from
him.
